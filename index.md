## About me  
### `print("Hello, World!")`  

My name is Elvin, and I am a Mathematics - Computer Science student at UC San Diego.  
I love applying problem-solving and programming skills to translate complex problems into simple mathematical frameworks, and enjoy building tools that make everyday life better.
